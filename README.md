# Simple Login with API Call

## Description
This project demonstrates a simple login screen implementation where user
credentials are sent to an API using an external library concept (Retrofit).

## Approach
- Created a login flow with email and password
- Used Retrofit as external library for API handling
- Separated API service, request, and response models

## Notes
This is a conceptual implementation focusing on API handling and login logic.

## Test Cases
Basic test cases are written to validate:
- Login with valid credentials
- Validation for empty or null inputs
- API method invocation on login action

Tests focus on functionality and logic rather than execution.
